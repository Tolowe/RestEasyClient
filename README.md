# Rest Easy Client

Rest Easy Client is a Http / Https client library for calling RESTful services. It uses a generics model based convention to generate the routes being called, with overloads to specify routes directly as well.

In the future, I will be adding caching, async await support, and other bells as and whistles as I think of them.

I started this project in an attempt to streamline some of the http clients I normally write into something more reusable. This is also inspired by other convention-based frameworks I have noticed in the open source ecosystem as well.
