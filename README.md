# Rest Easy Client

Rest Easy Client is a Http / Https client library for calling RESTful services. It uses a generics-model based convention based to generate the routes being called, with overloads to specify routes directly as well.

In the future, I will be adding caching, async await support, and other bells as and whistles as I think of them.
