# Rest Easy Client

Rest Easy Client is a Http / Https client library for calling RESTful services. It uses a generics model based convention to generate the routes being called, with overloads to specify routes directly as well.

In the future, I will be adding caching, async await support, and other bells as and whistles as I think of them.

This project is an attempt to make some of the work I do more re-usable and fun, and also I am inspired by convention-based frameworks such as Fixie and MVC, where naming drives use.
